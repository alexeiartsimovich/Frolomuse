/**
 * The heart of the app. It must be running as long as the app is alive.
 *
 * Here is the whole logic of playing, navigating and dispatching events.
 *
 * Communication with the service can be through binding to a special binder
 * returned by the [PlayerServiceDelegate.onBind] method or intents (see [newIntent]]).
 *
 * A little tutorial for this service.
 * When the service creates, it starts foreground by posting a notification;
 * The notification may be cancelled by user, it this case case the server stops foreground and STOPS ITSELF.
 * (!) If so and the service is NOT bound then the service will be destroyed.
 * Otherwise, if the service is bound, then it keeps working as if nothing has changed.
 * (!) If the service gets unbound and the notification was cancelled before, then it will be destroyed.
 * Thus the service may be in the following conditions:
 * 1) Not foreground and not bound => will be destroyed by the system asap (~60 seconds);
 * 2) Foreground but unbound => will keep working;
 * 3) Not foreground but bound => will keep working;
 * 4) Foreground and bound => will keep working;
 * So to be working as long as needed, the service must be at least foreground or bound.
